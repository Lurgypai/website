&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad to see you're interested in what I have to offer. Below are some projects I've made or am working on. If you like anything, (or find any bugs), join my <a href="https://discord.gg/xpzkFUn">discord</a> to talk about it! Because I haven't set this up as a secure website, I'm not comfortable having you download any executables here, so the links will lead you to my <a href="https://lurgypai.itch.io">itch.io page</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/Lurgypai">github</a> (unless its a pico-8 game).

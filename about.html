&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello there! My name is Keegan Sanchez, and I'm a developer from Washington State. I've been a hobbyist programmer since 2014, and worked on a variety of projects. I started by writing (bad) mods for the popular game Minecraft (back in version 1.6), and eventually moved to writing server plugins. After a while, I picked up the C++ programming language, and began writing games. Since then, I've released <a href="https://lurgypai.itch.io/">a few simple games</a> for practice, with some projects being written in C++ and a few being developed using <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico8</a> (I even have some projects targeting the <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>!). I've finished my bachelors in computer science, and am working on a masters. I've done research in filesystems and IO, and was lucky enough to present a paper at <a href="http://www.nas-conference.org/NAS-2022/program.html">NAS 2022</a>!
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also enjoy making all kinds of other media, hence why I made this website! It was built so I could share the digital doodads I make. I hope you find something you like on here!

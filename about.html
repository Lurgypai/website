&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello there! My name is Keegan Sanchez, and I'm a developer from Washington State. I've been a hobbyist programmer since 2014, and worked on a variety of projects. I started by writing (bad) mods for the popular game Minecraft (back in version 1.6), and evnetually moved to writing server plugins. After a while, I picked up the C++ programming language, and began writing games. Since then, I've released <a href="https://lurgypai.itch.io/">two simple games</a> for practice, and right now, I'm <a href="https://github.com/Lurgypai/Stabby">working on a third</a>!
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also enjoy making all kinds of other media, hence why I made this website! It was built so I could share the digital doodads I make. I hope you find something you like on here!
